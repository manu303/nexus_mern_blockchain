<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi there! I’m Alex Carter, a passionate UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developer with a love for creating intuitive, visually stunning digital experiences. With a background in visual arts and coding, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality. I thrive on solving problems creatively and believe every pixel has a purpose. When I’m not designing or debugging, you’ll find me sketching in my notebook or exploring the latest tech trends.</p>
